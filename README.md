# Malware

## Plan
nx, svelte, nest, mongo

## NX
Recommended to put [99% of code in libs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYNiOKDno_I&t=395s)








<hr>

## Development server

Run `nx serve malware-api` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching
Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
